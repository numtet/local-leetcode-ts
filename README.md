# local-LeedCode-ts

Local workspace for LeetCode, including typescript and jest configuration (in other words, this is just an empty repository for ts and jest).

You can make `.ts` and `.test.ts` for each problem within `problems/pXX` directory.
Also adding `.md` is nice to include description and images.

## Usage
```sh
npm install
```
